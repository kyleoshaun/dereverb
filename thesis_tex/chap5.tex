\chapter{Discussion and Conclusions}

* Big picture discussion of what we've learned, how doesa it compare to the literature, what are limitations, what would future directions

\section{Future Work Notes}

Covariance method for LP/MC-LP

Alternate minimization norm (not MSE, maybe something better suited perceptually).

Multi-Step/Delayed Linear Prediction to avoid cancellation of early reflections (and minimize overwhitening distortions)

Adaptive/STFT/Subband implementations (reduced complexity and better tracking at cost of worse convergence, maybe not big of a hit within the context of how much were actually able to acheive / including the amount of regularization im adding). What about a combination of the two?

Evaluation in combination with statistical speech enhancement method.

Compare LIME to DAP on a perceptual basis

Metrics work (review that section): Better binaural front-end (perceptual adaptations, impact of hearing loss), ...
